Project: Kuallpapers (KDE Plasma 6 wallpaper plugin, QML + JavaScript).

Guidelines:
- Prefer editing QML in contents/ui and JS in contents/code.
- Keep configuration keys aligned with contents/config/main.xml (kcfg). If you add/change a setting, update both QML and kcfg.
- Image paths should be portable: use package-relative paths like "images/1.jpg" or absolute paths/URLs. Never hardcode user-specific absolute paths.
- When resolving image paths, accept both raw filesystem paths and file:// URLs.
- Network access must use HTTPS and fail gracefully without blocking UI.
- Preserve existing style/formatting and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Use console logs sparingly and prefix with "Kuallpapers:" for consistency.
